# About the application

Javascript application using musixmatch API that gets the songs and their lyrics

## Notice

In order for that to work you need to create a javascript file called "config.js" in the "js" folder which will contain your API key,the variable name should be named "apikey" unless u wanna change it but you need to change the name also in the other javascript files.

Also if you want to use the free API key you will not get full access to all the stuff for example you will access 30% of the lyrics per song and its non commercial meaning that its only for testing.

## Get the api
